# README

* Prompt.ly is a full-stack application built in Ruby on Rails.

* The app makes use of several Ruby gems including Devise for user sign-ins and Acts_As_Votable for voting functionality.

* The app has full CRUD functionality for three models -- Prompt, Post and Comment.

* Future plans for the app include the creation of tags to help categorize prompts on the index page. Currently, prompts are ordered by upvotes. Ideally, the prompts would be ordered by upvotes within their tagged category.

* Also, the app will in the future ask users to create a username. This will give users a greater degree of anonymity on the site, rather than being identified by email.


-- For users (from Prompt.ly "About" page):

Welcome to Prompt.ly

Prompt.ly is an app that gets you writing.

It works like this:

1. Create a Prompt.ly account.

2. Create writing prompts to share with other users. Please include a photo url with your written prompt.

3. Write story entries for as many prompts as you'd like.

4. Upvote or downvote other prompts and story entries. (Remember, you must be signed in to write or edit prompts and posts, and also to upvote or downvote other users' prompts and posts).

5. Get started HERE. If you're not interested in the first randomized prompt you're presented, click 'Next' to toggle through other prompts, or click 'Trending Prompts' at the top of the page.

6. Go back to step 2 and do it all over again.
